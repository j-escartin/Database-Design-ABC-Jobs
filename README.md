# Database-Design-ABC-Jobs

Project for Database Design and Implementation

## Project Overview

ABC Jobs Pte Ltd. approached the programmer about creating a website, a community network for software developers. It is similar to platforms such as LinkedIn and other community portals. Users will be divided into two groups: software developers and administrators. Page. Common Users (Software Developers) of the site can search for other users by entering their First Name, Last Name, Company Name, City, and Country. After searching for them, users will be able to browse their Public Profiles. Users can utilize the portal to log in, request a lost password, and change their profile information. The administrator's responsibility is to maintain user data and to send newsletters, subscription letters, and other mass emails via email funneling.
	
### Existing System

The database for the system was created by the programmer. The portals require a large amount of data, so creating a database is essential. Data should be organized and flow properly to avoid potential mistakes such as extended fetching times, etc. The development process is step-by-step, beginning with the conceptual design of the database and ending with its implementation. It is also subjected to a rigorous evaluation by the mentors, as well as several testing procedures to ensure the database's integrity.

### Need for Database System
A database is required while creating a community portal or other website. It's critical since this is what maintains data intact and ready to utilize as soon as the site requests it. A database management system optimizes the site's productivity by categorizing and organizing available data, and it provides multi-access, newer and better ways to manage data (Hooda, 2022). Databases are already widely used all over the world: every website you visit, mall counters, and even your school's records. It needs a database to complete the work at hand.
